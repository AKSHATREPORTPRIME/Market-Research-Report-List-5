<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Encoder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Incremental Rotary Encoders</li><li>Absolute Rotary Encoders</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary encoders are devices used to measure the position and rotation of a shaft. There are two main types of rotary encoders: incremental rotary encoders and absolute rotary encoders. Incremental rotary encoders produce a series of pulses to measure incremental changes in position, while absolute rotary encoders provide a unique digital code for every position, allowing for precise positioning. These two types of rotary encoders cater to different market needs, with incremental encoders being more cost-effective for applications that do not require absolute position accuracy.</p></p>
