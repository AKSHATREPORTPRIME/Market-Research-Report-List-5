<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non invasive Positive Pressure Ventilators NiPPV Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CPAP Ventilation Machine</li><li>BiPAP Ventilation Machine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-invasive Positive Pressure Ventilators (NiPPV) are divided into two main types: CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) and BiPAP (Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure) machines. CPAP machines deliver a continuous stream of air at a constant pressure to help keep the airways open during sleep, typically used for treating sleep apnea. BiPAP machines deliver two levels of pressure - a higher level when breathing in and a lower level when breathing out, often used for patients with more complex breathing issues such as COPD.</p></p>
