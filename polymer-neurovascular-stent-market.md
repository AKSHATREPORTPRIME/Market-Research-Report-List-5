<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Polymer Neurovascular Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Carotid artery stents</li><li>Intracranial stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Polymer neurovascular stents are medical devices used to treat blood vessel blockages in the brain. Carotid artery stents are specifically designed for the treatment of blockages in the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain. Intracranial stents are used to treat blockages within the blood vessels of the brain itself. Both types of stents are made from polymer material and are inserted into the affected blood vessel to restore proper blood flow and prevent strokes or other complications. These stents are an important tool in the treatment of neurovascular diseases.</p></p>
