<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The DNA Vaccines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Recombinant Protein Vaccine</li><li>Gene-Based Vaccine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>DNA vaccines are categorized into two main types: recombinant protein vaccines and gene-based vaccines. Recombinant protein vaccines involve the insertion of DNA coding for a particular protein into the host, which then produces the protein and triggers an immune response. Gene-based vaccines, on the other hand, involve the direct insertion of DNA into the host, where it is translated into a protein that stimulates an immune response. Both types of DNA vaccines offer promising advancements in the field of immunization.</p></p>
