<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Phenolic Resin For Buildings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic Phenolic Resin</li><li>Thermosetting Phenolic Resin</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Phenolic resin is commonly used in buildings due to its excellent fire resistance, durability, and chemical resistance. There are two main types of phenolic resin used in the construction industry: thermoplastic phenolic resin and thermosetting phenolic resin. Thermoplastic phenolic resin can be re-molded and reused, making it suitable for applications where flexibility is required. Thermosetting phenolic resin, on the other hand, cures irreversibly when heated, providing high strength and stability in building materials. Both types play a significant role in enhancing the structural integrity and longevity of buildings.</p></p>
