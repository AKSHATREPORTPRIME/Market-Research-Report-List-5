<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transient Suppressor (TVS) Diodes Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Uni-Polar TVS</li><li>Bi-Polar TVS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transient Suppressor (TVS) diodes come in two main types: Uni-Polar TVS and Bi-Polar TVS. Uni-Polar TVS are designed to protect against voltage spikes in one direction only, making them ideal for applications where protection is only needed for one polarity. On the other hand, Bi-Polar TVS can protect against voltage spikes in both directions, providing more comprehensive protection. Both types of TVS diodes are crucial in safeguarding electronic circuits from transient voltage events such as electrostatic discharge and lightning strikes.</p></p>
