<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scroll Chiller Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water-Cooled Scroll Chillers</li><li>Air-Cooled Scroll Chillers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scroll chillers are refrigeration systems that remove heat from a liquid through a vapor-compression cycle. In the market, there are two main types of scroll chillers: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled scroll chillers use water to absorb heat from the refrigerant, while air-cooled scroll chillers release heat into the air. Water-cooled scroll chillers are generally more energy efficient and quieter, but require additional infrastructure for water circulation. Air-cooled scroll chillers are easier to install and maintain, but may be less efficient in hot climates.</p></p>
