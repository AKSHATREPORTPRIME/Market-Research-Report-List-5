<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Composite CNG Cylinders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Type III</li><li>Type IV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Composite CNG cylinders are classified into two main types - Type III and Type IV. Type III cylinders have a metal liner made of steel or aluminum, with a carbon fiber overwrap for added strength. These cylinders are lighter and provide better impact resistance compared to Type I and Type II cylinders. On the other hand, Type IV cylinders have a plastic liner and a carbon fiber overwrap, offering higher strength-to-weight ratio and improved durability. Type IV cylinders are typically lighter and more expensive than Type III cylinders.</p></p>
