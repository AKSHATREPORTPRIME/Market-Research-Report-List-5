<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flame Retardant PA66 Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Halogen Type</li><li>Halogen Free Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flame retardant PA66 can be classified into two main types: Halogen Type and Halogen Free Type. Halogen Type flame retardants contain halogen elements such as bromine or chlorine, which help in limiting the spread of fire by releasing flame-quenching gases when heated. On the other hand, Halogen Free Type flame retardants do not contain any halogen elements and rely on alternative additives like phosphorus, nitrogen, or mineral fillers to achieve flame resistance. Both types have their advantages and limitations, depending on the specific application requirements.</p></p>
