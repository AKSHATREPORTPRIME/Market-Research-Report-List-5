<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Semiconductor PVD Thin Film Deposition Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum Evaporation</li><li>Sputtering</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Semiconductor PVD Thin Film Deposition Equipment market includes two main types: Vacuum Evaporation and Sputtering. Vacuum Evaporation involves heating a material in a vacuum chamber until it evaporates and then condensing it onto the substrate to form a thin film. Sputtering, on the other hand, uses plasma to dislodge atoms from a target material, which are then deposited onto the substrate to create the thin film. Both techniques are widely used in the semiconductor industry for various applications such as microelectronics and optical coatings.</p></p>
