<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pressure Infusor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Pressure Infusor</li><li>Automatic Pressure Infusor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A manual pressure infusor is a medical device used to administer intravenous (IV) fluids or medications at a controlled rate through manual compression. It is operated by healthcare professionals by squeezing a manual bulb to apply pressure to the IV bag. On the other hand, an automatic pressure infusor is a more advanced device that automatically regulates the pressure within the IV bag to ensure a consistent flow rate without the need for manual intervention. Both types of pressure infusors are essential tools in healthcare settings for providing efficient IV therapy to patients.</p></p>
