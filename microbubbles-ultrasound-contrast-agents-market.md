<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microbubbles & Ultrasound Contrast Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Power Ultrasound</li><li>Detection of Ultrasonic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Microbubbles are small gas-filled bubbles that can be used as contrast agents in ultrasound imaging. When exposed to ultrasound waves, these bubbles resonate and enhance the reflection of the ultrasound waves, improving the detection of tissues and blood flow in the body. There are two main types of ultrasound contrast agents: power ultrasound, which uses high-intensity ultrasound waves to create images, and detection ultrasound, which utilizes the contrast agents to highlight specific areas of interest within the body.</p></p>
