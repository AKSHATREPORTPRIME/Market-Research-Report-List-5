<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Resin Composite Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dimethacrylates</li><li>Organically Modified Ceramics (OrMoCers)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental resin composite materials are commonly classified into two main types: dimethacrylates and organically modified ceramics (OrMoCers). Dimethacrylates are polymer-based materials that contain two methacrylate groups, allowing for strong bonds to tooth structure. On the other hand, OrMoCers are a newer type of composite material that combines the strength of ceramics with the versatility of organic polymers. OrMoCers exhibit improved esthetics, durability, and biocompatibility, making them a popular choice in modern dental restorations.</p></p>
