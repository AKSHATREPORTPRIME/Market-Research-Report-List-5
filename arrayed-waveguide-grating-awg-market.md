<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Arrayed Waveguide Grating (AWG) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal AWG</li><li>Athermal AWG</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Arrayed Waveguide Gratings (AWGs) are used in optical communication systems to separate and combine multiple wavelengths of light. There are two main types of AWGs: Thermal AWGs and Athermal AWGs. </p><p>Thermal AWGs require temperature stabilization to maintain consistent performance, making them more suitable for controlled environments. Athermal AWGs, on the other hand, are designed to operate effectively over a wide temperature range without the need for external temperature control. This makes them ideal for applications where temperature fluctuations are common or difficult to control.</p></p>
