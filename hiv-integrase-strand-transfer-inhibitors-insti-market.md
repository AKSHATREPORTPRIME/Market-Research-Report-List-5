<p><h1>HIV Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTI) Market Provides Detailed Segmentation of this Market based on Type, Application, and Region and Forecast for the Period from 2024 - 2031</h1></p><p><strong>HIV Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTI) Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>HIV Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTIs) are a class of antiretroviral drugs used in the treatment of HIV/AIDS. INSTIs work by blocking the action of the HIV enzyme integrase, which is responsible for inserting the viral DNA into the DNA of the host cell. This prevents the virus from replicating and spreading throughout the body.</p><p>The HIV Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTI) Market is expected to experience substantial growth in the coming years, with a projected CAGR of 14.3% during the forecast period. This growth can be attributed to factors such as the increasing prevalence of HIV/AIDS worldwide, the introduction of newer and more effective INSTI drugs, and the rising awareness about the importance of early diagnosis and treatment of the disease.</p><p>Moreover, the development of fixed-dose combination drugs containing INSTIs is also expected to drive market growth, as it offers convenience and improved adherence for patients. Additionally, ongoing research and development efforts aimed at expanding the treatment options for HIV/AIDS are expected to further propel the growth of the HIV Integrase Strand Transfer Inhibitors (INSTI) Market.</p></p>
