<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In-Place Inclinometers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical</li><li>Level</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-Place Inclinometers are devices used to measure the tilt or slope of a structure or ground surface. There are two main types of in-place inclinometers: vertical and level. Vertical inclinometers are used to measure the inclination of structures such as retaining walls, slopes, and piles. Level inclinometers, on the other hand, are used to measure the horizontal inclination of structures like dams and bridges. Both types of inclinometers play a crucial role in ensuring the stability and safety of various structures.</p></p>
