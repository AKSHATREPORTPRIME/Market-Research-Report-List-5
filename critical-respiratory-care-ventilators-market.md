<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Critical Respiratory Care Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-Invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Critical respiratory care ventilators are devices used to provide mechanical ventilation to patients with respiratory failure. There are two main types of ventilators - invasive and non-invasive. Invasive ventilators require insertion of a tube into the patient's airway, while non-invasive ventilators deliver air through a mask or nasal prongs. Invasive ventilation is often used for patients with severe respiratory failure, while non-invasive ventilation is commonly used for patients with less severe respiratory conditions or those who cannot tolerate invasive ventilation.</p></p>
