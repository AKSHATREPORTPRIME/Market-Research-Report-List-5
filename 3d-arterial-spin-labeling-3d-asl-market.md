<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The 3D Arterial Spin Labeling (3D ASL) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CASL</li><li>PASL</li></ul></p>
<p><p>3D Arterial Spin Labeling (3D ASL) is a non-invasive MRI technique used to measure blood flow in the brain. Two main types of 3D ASL are Continuous ASL (CASL) and Pulsed ASL (PASL). CASL uses continuous radiofrequency pulses to label arterial blood while PASL uses discrete radiofrequency pulses. CASL provides higher signal-to-noise ratio and better quantification of blood flow, while PASL allows for faster imaging. Both techniques have their unique advantages and are utilized in different clinical and research settings.</p></p>
