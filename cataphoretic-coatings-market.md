<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cataphoretic Coatings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anodic Electrophoretic Coating</li><li>Cathodic Electrophoretic Coating</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cataphoretic coatings refer to a type of coating process where the paint particles are electrically deposited onto a surface. There are two main types of cataphoretic coatings: Anodic Electrophoretic Coating and Cathodic Electrophoretic Coating. In Anodic Electrophoretic Coating, the metal part acts as the anode and attracts negatively charged paint particles, while in Cathodic Electrophoretic Coating, the metal part acts as the cathode and attracts positively charged paint particles. Both types of coatings offer effective corrosion protection and a uniform finish.</p></p>
