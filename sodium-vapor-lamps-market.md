<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sodium Vapor Lamps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure Sodium Lamp</li><li>Low Pressure Sodium Lamp</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Sodium vapor lamps are classified into two main types: High Pressure Sodium Lamp and Low Pressure Sodium Lamp. High Pressure Sodium Lamps produce a bright, white light that closely resembles natural sunlight, making them ideal for outdoor street lighting. On the other hand, Low Pressure Sodium Lamps emit a monochromatic yellow light, which is more energy-efficient and has better visibility in foggy conditions. Both types of lamps are commonly used in outdoor lighting applications, but their specific qualities make them suitable for different purposes.</p></p>
