<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Solar Pool Blanket Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentrated Formula</li><li>Non-concentrated Formula</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The liquid solar pool blanket market can be categorized into two main types: concentrated formula and non-concentrated formula. Concentrated formula products are highly potent and require smaller amounts to effectively cover the pool surface, making them more cost-effective in the long run. On the other hand, non-concentrated formula products are ready to use and can be applied directly without any dilution. Both types of liquid solar pool blankets aim to reduce heat loss and evaporation from the pool, helping to conserve energy and maintain optimal water temperature.</p></p>
