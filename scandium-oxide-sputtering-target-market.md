<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Scandium Oxide Sputtering Target Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rotatable Transformation</li><li>Non Rotating Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Scandium oxide sputtering targets can be divided into two main types: Rotatable Transformation and Non-Rotating Type markets. Rotatable Transformation targets are designed to rotate during the sputtering process, ensuring uniform deposition on the substrate. Non-Rotating Type targets, on the other hand, remain stationary during sputtering. Each type caters to specific requirements and preferences of the end-users, with Rotatable Transformation targets being more suitable for high-volume production and Non-Rotating Type targets being preferred for research and development purposes.</p></p>
