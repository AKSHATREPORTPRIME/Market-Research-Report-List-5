<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Synthetic Polymer Hemodialysis Membrane Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Flux Membrane</li><li>High Flux Membrane</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Synthetic Polymer Hemodialysis Membrane Market consists of two main types, Low Flux Membrane and High Flux Membrane. Low Flux Membrane is a type of membrane that allows for low diffusion of solutes and is typically used for less intense hemodialysis treatments. On the other hand, High Flux Membrane has a larger pore size which enables higher diffusion rates, making it more suitable for patients in need of more thorough cleansing during hemodialysis. Both types play a crucial role in providing effective treatment for patients with kidney failure.</p></p>
