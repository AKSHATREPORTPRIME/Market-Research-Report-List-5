<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Water-based Muds Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dispersible</li><li>Not Dispersible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Water-based muds are categorized into two main types: dispersible and not dispersible. Dispersible muds can be easily broken down by adding water, making them ideal for cleaning up after drilling operations. On the other hand, not dispersible muds do not break down when in contact with water, making them more suitable for drilling in environments where dispersible muds would not be effective. Both types of water-based muds have their own uses and benefits in the drilling industry.</p></p>
