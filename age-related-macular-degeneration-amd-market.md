<p><p>Age Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition that affects the macula, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision. There are two main types of AMD: Wet AMD and Dry AMD. Wet AMD is characterized by the growth of abnormal blood vessels under the macula, leading to central vision loss. Dry AMD, on the other hand, is caused by the gradual breakdown of light-sensitive cells in the macula. Both types of AMD can result in severe vision impairment if left untreated.</p></p>
